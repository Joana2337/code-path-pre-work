# Prework - *Habit*

Submitted by: ** Joana Osei **

**Name of your app** is an app that shows name, current college and aspiring job.   

Time spent: **19** This number is a guess, I run into some issues yesterday and had to stop and work on it this morning.

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [Y] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ N ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color #My program changes its background ramdomly but pushing the "Chnage" button doesn't make it work.
 
## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes
-> 3 - 5 favorite application - Habits, Goodreads, Maps. 
-> Features that makes them my favorite apps 
-> Habits - It has an interactive UI that allows me to track the things that I said I will do in a day/week/months. 
-> Goodreads - This app allows me to add a book that I am currently reading, track my reading processes and also provides book ratings. 
-> Maps - Since I love travelling a lot I use my map all the time, the structure, the 3-D imaging and lots of features are really helping. 

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
-> I got stuck at step 3 connecting UI to Login. "The control + drag" instruction wasn't that clear to me,later found out,but I think I made a mistake somewhere hence, my app not changing background color when the change button is clicked but instead changing color background anytime the program is run.  

##An app that I want to build.
Definitely a habits app. An interactive app with more features than the one I am currently using. A habits app that will help the user generate a plan and processes needed to take in other to achieve his/her habit goal by generating a plan/processes on daily bases on how to go about it if the user do not have any.
